     This was the hole the rule shipped with, and four of the eight components
     had it: `font-size: var(--guest-size)` with `--guest-size: 34px` is text in
     px, and the first version of this guard called it rem-clean. The property
     even said so out loud — «in px, like the export» — which is the shape a
     guard is supposed to catch rather than the shape it is fooled by.
     Scope is not modelled, exactly as in checkUndefinedCustomProperties: a
     declaration anywhere in the text counts. The alternative is resolving the
     cascade, and what is being hunted here is a name that is px everywhere it
     is declared. */
