/* The two institutional pages, as they reach a browser.
 *
 * Everything they say is one of two kinds, and the whole of this file is about
 * telling them apart. What the repository knows — where the association meets,
 * which number answers — has to be published from where it is kept, spelled
 * once. What the repository does not know is published as an obvious
 * placeholder, marked, and must not be able to slip out of being one.
 *
 * Neither failure shows on a screenshot. An address copied out of the design is
 * a building this association has never been in, on a page that renders
 * perfectly; a placeholder that lost its frame is lorem ipsum being read as
 * something somebody said.
