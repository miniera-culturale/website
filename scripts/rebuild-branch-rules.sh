# Rebuilds the rules protecting `main`, from nothing.
#
# Applied on 15 August 2026. This is not here to repair something that broke —
# it is here for whoever asks *why* it is arranged this way, and for the day the
# same arrangement has to be made somewhere else.
#
# **Why two rulesets and not a classic branch protection.** The plan said: give
# the CMS account a bypass on the required pull request. It does not work, and
# that was established rather than assumed — on a throwaway branch, with commits
# made through the contents API, which is how Sveltia commits and not a git push:
#
#   PR required + bypass + required status checks ... 409, "Required status
#                                                     check verify is expected"
#   PR required + bypass, no status checks ......... commit accepted
#   Ruleset with PR + checks, with a bypass ........ commit accepted
#   The same ruleset, bypass removed ............... 409 on both rules
#
# `bypass_pull_request_allowances` waives the pull request and nothing else. The
# required status checks of a classic protection have no exception list at all,
# and `verify` cannot pass on a commit that has not been accepted yet — so the
# CMS stays out either way. Inside a ruleset a bypass waives the whole ruleset,
# status checks included. The fourth line exists because "it worked" and "the
# rule was not looking" resemble each other too closely to trust the third alone.
#
# **Why two and not one.** A bypass is granted per ruleset, not per rule. With a
# single one, the team that can save from the CMS could also rewrite the history
# of `main`.
#
# **Why the bypass names a team and not an account.** At PR 21 the CMS signs in
# through OAuth and commits as whoever signed in, so an account "for the
# editors" would be a shared credential to hand out now and withdraw then.
#
# **Why ~DEFAULT_BRANCH and not refs/heads/main.** If the default branch is ever
# renamed the rules follow it, instead of staying on a name that no longer
# exists — which is the quiet way a ruleset stops watching anything.
