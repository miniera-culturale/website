/**
 * Builds public/favicon.ico out of public/favicon.svg.
 *
 * The .svg is what current browsers use; the .ico is for the ones that do not
 * take it, and for the crawlers that ask for /favicon.ico and nothing else.
 * Keeping it generated rather than hand-made is what stops the two from
 * drifting — but only as long as generating it is not a step someone has to
 * remember: `npm run build` runs it, and a build-layer test asserts that the
 * published .ico is what the current drawing produces.
 *
 * sharp writes PNG, not ICO, and an ICO is little more than a header plus a
 * list of images — since Vista it may hold PNG payloads verbatim, which is what
 * this does.
