/* What `public/robots.txt` is allowed to say, and it depends on one thing.
 *
 * Until the domain exists the site lives on a `pages.dev` address, which is
 * public and crawlable — deploy previews Cloudflare marks itself, production
 * ones it does not. The day the domain arrives there would be two identical
 * sites with a search engine picking one, and the one it picked would be the
 * one nobody links to. So: no domain, no indexing; domain, indexing plus the
 * sitemap. It is the switch of `og:url` and of `checkNoPlaceholders`, pointed
 * at a third thing, and it is read from the configuration rather than
 * remembered — see PR 17 and the domain step.
 *
 * And a second rule that does not flip, because it is the one that is easy to
 * get backwards: **`/admin` and `/componenti` are never `Disallow`ed.** A
 * `Disallow` does not remove an address from an index — it tells the crawler
 * not to *read* the page, and a page that is never read is a page whose
 * `noindex` is never seen, so the bare URL can be listed anyway. Both pages
 * already carry `noindex` (the gallery from PR 6, the editing desk from
 * PR 14), and that is the mechanism that works; forbidding them here would
 * switch it off. Today it changes nothing, because `Disallow: /` covers
 * everything. It changes when the domain arrives, which is the moment the defect would be
 * published — which is why it is written down now, while somebody is looking.
