/* Guards over the text this site does not have yet.
 *
 * The institutional pages carry the design's structure and none of its prose:
 * a founding story, four people and four statistics that belong to no
 * association. What stands in for them is deliberately unmistakable — lorem
 * ipsum, `Nome Cognome`, `0000` — because the alternative is the failure this
 * repository exists to catch: a page that renders perfectly, says something
 * false, and fails nowhere.
 *
 * Obvious is not the same as safe, though, and three things are checked rather
 * than trusted.
 *
 * A placeholder that loses its mark stops being declared and starts being
 * content. The mark is a component — src/components/Placeholder.astro — so it
 * cannot be forgotten while the text is kept; what this reads is dist/, where
 * the two would have come apart.
 *
 * A placeholder written in a page instead of in the module is one the
 * replacement will miss. `src/lib/placeholder.ts` is where they all are, and
 * «all of them» is the property that makes replacing them one edit.
 *
 * And a placeholder must not survive the site getting an address of its own.
 * That is `checkNoPlaceholders`, armed by `site` in astro.config.mjs exactly as
 * `og:url` is: the day PR 21 sets the domain, this turns red and the only way
 * past it is the real text. Which is the point — a real domain with lorem ipsum
 * on it is the one thing worse than no domain. docs/questioni-aperte.md says so
 * where PR 21 will read it.
