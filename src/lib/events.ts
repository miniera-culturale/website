 *
 * Two properties hold this file together, and both have a guard:
 *
 * 1. It imports nothing. The shapes it works on are described structurally,
 *    so the module runs under a plain `node src/lib/events.ts` — which is how
 *    the suite proves it answers the same under TZ=UTC and TZ=Europe/Rome.
 *    Not even astro:content is imported for its types: programme.ts is what
 *    hands the real entries over, and that is where the schema and these
 *    shapes are checked against one another.
 * 2. It never asks what time it is. `now` always arrives as an argument,
 *    because a boundary that reads the clock cannot be tested, only waited
 *    for.
 *
 * Cloudflare builds in UTC and the evenings happen in Turin. Every formatter
 * below therefore names Europe/Rome, and `isPast` compares civil dates instead
 * of doing arithmetic on offsets: there is no `+2` written anywhere to get
 * wrong twice a year.
