/* The response headers Cloudflare Pages sends, generated rather than written.
 *
 * Same family as cycles.ts and shapes.ts: a file the build emits, built by a
 * pure function so that a test can ask what it says without running a build.
 * What makes it belong here rather than in scripts/ is that the answer depends
 * on the site — on what the pages actually contain — and not on how the site is
 * assembled.
 *
 * **Why it cannot be written by hand.** This site publishes nine pages and not
 * one external script: every line of JavaScript it runs is `is:inline`, by four
 * separate decisions that all had good reasons — the class that comes off
 * <html> before anything is painted, the modal, the two of the scroller — plus
 * the `<style is:inline>` of CycleAccents and whatever Astro decides to inline.
 * A Content-Security-Policy that reaches them has two forms: `'unsafe-inline'`,
 * which is a policy written to pass, or hashes, which are exact. Hashes change
 * every time one of those lines changes, and a hash written by hand in a file
 * nobody rebuilds is right the day it is written and wrong the first day
 * somebody edits a script — with no test, no build failure and no sign at all,
 * because the page still renders. What sees it is a visitor with the console
 * open.
 *
 * **And they are taken from dist/, not from the source.** What a browser hashes
 * is the bytes it received, and between the two there is `compressHTML` and
 * whatever else the build does to a document. It is the same lesson as the
 * collapsed CSS fallback, in a third disguise.
 *
 * `/admin` gets its own, wider and declared. It is the one place here where a
 * policy does real work — JavaScript with write access to the repository — and
 * also the one place where a policy that is too tight breaks something in a way
 * only a person can notice: the CMS refusing to save. Every relaxation on that
 * row is written with what needs it.

/**

 * and not a `style` attribute** — those are `style-src-attr`, and they need
 * `'unsafe-hashes'` — and this design system passes sizes as custom properties
 * in exactly that way: `Brand` writes `--brand-height: 14px`, `GuestRow`
 * `--guest-size`, `EpisodeBadge` and `SignatureBand` their own. Blocked, every
 * one of them fell back to the default in its stylesheet, and the page rendered
 * perfectly at the wrong size with a green build behind it.
 *
 * Two ways out, and the tighter one is worse here. `'unsafe-hashes'` with the
 * hash of every attribute value would keep the policy exact — the generator
 * already reads dist/, so collecting them is a few lines — but it is understood
 * by browsers from Safari 15.4, which is exactly this project's floor, and a
 * browser that does not understand it **silently reproduces the bug we just
 * shipped**. That is the failure mode this whole file is written against, and
 * paying for it in exchange for a stricter style policy is the wrong trade: an
 * attacker who cannot inject a script cannot reach these attributes either, and
 * `script-src` is where the value is and stays exact.
 *
 * `'unsafe-inline'` and hashes cannot both apply: the presence of a hash makes
 * a browser ignore `'unsafe-inline'`. So the element hashes come out with it,
 * and `checkStyleAttributes` is what stops this from drifting back.

 * the values are joined with a comma separator»: `/admin/…` matches the admin
 * row *and* `/*`, so the editing desk would be sent both policies in one header.
 * A comma in a `Content-Security-Policy` is not a list of sources, it is a list of
 * **policies**, and a browser enforces all of them at once — so the site's
 * `default-src 'self'`, which names no `connect-src`, would go on forbidding
 * `api.github.com` however wide the row underneath it was written. The CMS would
 * not save, which is the one failure this whole file is arranged to prevent, and
 * the only person who would find out is whoever tried.
 *
 * So each admin row takes the site's policy **off** before declaring its own,
 * with the `!` Cloudflare documents for exactly this — «remove a header which
 * has been added by a more pervasive rule». The order still matters, and now for
 * a reason that is true: a detach only removes what an earlier rule has already
 * added, so an admin row written above `/*` would detach nothing and then have
 * the site's policy appended after it. `checkHeaderPolicy` holds both halves,
 * and the same for the order **inside** the row — a detach written under the
 * policy it shares a rule with is a question about Cloudflare that nothing here
 * can answer, and the answer arrives in production.
 *
 * No `Strict-Transport-Security`. It is a promise with a long expiry, made on
 * an address this project abandons when the domain arrives; it comes with it, in the
